# wordFrequency

The Class DemoApplication has a variable "test1", this is where  <br />
you can change the string input when running the program.  <br />

I also added unit tests in WordFrequencyUnitTests.  You can modify the  <br /> 
strings in there as well.

The logic is in WordFrequency.

To Build the application you need the latest maven and java <br />

`./mvnw clean install`

To run the application

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

To run the unit tests

`./mvnw clean test`
